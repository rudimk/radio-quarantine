# radio-quarantine
An experiment at livecoding an album while under quarantine.

While the original plan was to work exclusively with Sonic Pi, I've lately gotten rather attracted to Overtone. So this.."mixtape" will probably have music written in a mix of Sonic Pi or Overtone. This repo contains the code, while the finished tracks are hosted on SoundCloud.
